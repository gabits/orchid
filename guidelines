# Guidelines for the Codebase

## Architecture
In all languages and frameworks used, the code should be as self-documented as possible.

### Comments
Those should follow each language's responsibilities TODOs should not be exposed to user-facing code such as static files.


## HTML and CSS
Comments: should be included mostly to organise, hierarchise and structure the code and reinforce its readability.
