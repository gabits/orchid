# Orchid


## Concept

The idea of this project is to build a open-source website where registered users can create profiles and post original content produced by them. The publications can be posted in the form of pictures, audio, video, text, and there's a separate section where articles are posted for discussion.

Users will also be able to upload short code scripts which will can be manually or automatically ran when visiting their profiles, generating a personalised user experience to each profile visited.


## Installation

In your preferred virtual environment for this purpose, run:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Add a file named `.env` in the top directory ('orchid') and manipulate environment variables from there.
