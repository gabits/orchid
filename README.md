# Orchid 

## Development

This is currently a project in its initial stage of development. External contributions are welcome in the form of code reviews, critics and suggestions. One of the original purposes with this is to grow and consolidate my skills developing web applications, but if you'd like to contribute as a designer or developer, please get in contact.


## The project

The idea is to build a **open-source** website where registered users can create profiles and post *original content* produced by them. The publications can be posted in the form of **pictures**, **audio**, **video**, **text**. Users will also be able to upload *short code scripts* which can be ran when visiting their profiles, generating a *personalised user experience* to each profile visited. 

It'll also involve a separate section of pre-approved **articles** to be posted for discussions, which will be related to the type of content vehiculed by the website.
